# Council Housing

## Apply for a council home

- You apply for council housing through your local council.
- Each council has its own rules.
- You’ll usually have to join a waiting list and you’re not guaranteed to get a property. Ask your council how long you’re likely to have to wait.
- You can apply if you’re 18 or over (some councils let you apply if you’re 16 or over).

::note
  You may be able to apply even if you do not live in the area.
