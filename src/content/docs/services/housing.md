# Council Housing

## Apply for a council home

- You apply for council housing through your local council.
- Each council has its own rules.
- You’ll usually have to join a waiting list and you’re not guaranteed to get a property. Ask your council how long you’re likely to have to wait.
- You can apply if you’re 18 or over (some councils let you apply if you’re 16 or over).

::note
  You may be able to apply even if you do not live in the area.
:::

## Waiting lists

Councils decide who gets offered housing based on a ‘current housing severity’ system.

this system is based on housing needs and current conditions. For example, you’re likely to be offered housing first if you:

- are homeless
- live in cramped conditions
- have a medical condition made worse by your current home

Once you’re high enough on the list, your council will contact you about an available property.

## Choice-based lettings

Some councils have a choice-based letting scheme. This lets you tell your council which properties you’re interested in. It depends on the council, but once you’ve been accepted onto the waiting list, the basic steps are:

- Find a property: check in local papers, on council websites, in council offices or in local libraries.
::note
  Check you can apply for it: some properties are only suitable for single people, families or disabled people.
:::
- Apply: this is known as ‘bidding’, but it does not involve money. You can bid online, by phone or by text.
- Get the council’s decision.

## Getting an offer
Normally you only have a short time to accept a housing offer. If you do not accept it, you can usually stay on the waiting list (or bid for other properties), but you may be put lower down the list.
You may be taken off the list temporarily if you keep rejecting offers.
You can appeal if you’re not happy with your council’s decision.

::tip
 Accept a housing offer as soon as you are able to since it may be an elongated amount of time until you get another offer

# Housing Benefit

## Eligibility

Housing Benefit can help you pay your rent if you’re unemployed, on a low income or claiming benefits. It’s being replaced by Universal Credit.
You can only make a new claim for Housing Benefit if either of the following apply:
- you have reached State Pension age
- you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing



## You’ve reached State Pension age
If you’re single you can make a new claim for Housing Benefit.

### If you’re over State Pension age and live with your partner
You can make a new claim for Housing Benefit if any of the following apply:

- you and your partner have both reached State Pension age
- one of you has reached State Pension age and started claiming Pension Credit (for you as a couple)
- you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing

### If you’re over State Pension age and have an existing claim
Your existing claim will not be affected if, before ENTER A DATE., you:

- were getting Housing Benefit
- had reached State Pension age

::note
 It does not matter if your partner is under State Pension age.
:::

If your circumstances change and your Housing Benefit is stopped, you cannot start getting it again unless you and your partner are eligible to make a new claim.


## If you’re in supported, sheltered or temporary housing

You can make a new claim if:

- you’re living in temporary accommodation, such as a B&B arranged by your council
- you’re living in a refuge for survivors of domestic abuse
- you’re living in sheltered or supported housing (such as a hostel) which provides you with ‘care, support or supervision’

## When you may not be able to claim
Usually, you will not get Housing Benefit if:

- your savings are over £16,000 - unless you get Guarantee Credit of Pension Credit
- you’re paying a mortgage on your own home - you may be able to get Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI)
- you live in the home of a close relative
- you’re already claiming Universal Credit (unless you’re in temporary or supported housing)
- you live with your partner and they are already claiming Housing Benefit
- you’re a full-time student
- you’re an asylum seeker or sponsored to be in the UK
- you’re subject to immigration control and your granted leave states that you cannot claim public funds
- you’re a Crown Tenant
- you’ve reached State Pension age but your live-in partner has not - unless you had an existing claim as a couple before INSERT START OF TAX YEAR/ ACTUAL YEAR DATE REDUCE 4 YEARS FROM CURRENT

You may be able to get other help with housing costs.


# Rent-a-Room Scheme
If your gross receipts from letting are not more than the Rent-a-Room limit of £7,500 (or £3,750), you do not pay tax on your profit. If they’re more than the limit, you may still be able to benefit under the Rent-a-Room Scheme.

Your gross receipts include:

- rental income (before expenses)
- any amounts you receive for meals, goods and services, such as cleaning or laundry
- any ‘balancing charges’
You usually count your gross receipts for a tax year — that’s, from INSERT START OF TAX YEAR one year to INSERT END OF TAX YEAR the next.
