At Leosia, we cherish our furry, feathered, and scaled companions and are committed to their safety, well-being, and the harmony of our communities. To ensure responsible pet ownership and a safe environment for all residents, we have established regulations that must be followed when owning pets.

## Microchips and Registration

### Microchipping Requirement
All pets in Leosia are required to be microchipped. Microchipping provides a safe and reliable way to identify your pet and aids in their quick return if they ever become lost. Ensure that your pet's microchip is registered and up-to-date with your contact information.

### Registration with the Leosian Animal Control Department
Pet owners must register their pets with the Leosian Animal Control Department. Registration helps us maintain accurate records of pets in our communities and ensures that pets receive timely vaccinations and care. It also assists in reuniting lost pets with their owners.

## Collars and Nametags

### Collars and Nametags Requirement
Pets must wear collars with visible nametags at all times when in public spaces. Nametags should include the pet's name and your contact information. This helps in identifying pets and reuniting them with their owners if they become lost.

## Pet Selection

### No Aggressive Pets
Leosia places a strong emphasis on safety. Pets known to have aggressive tendencies or a history of violent behavior are not permitted. We strive to create a peaceful and secure environment for everyone.

### No Endangered or Dangerous Pets
Ownership of endangered or dangerous animals is strictly prohibited in Leosia. This policy is in place to protect both the community and the well-being of these animals.

## Responsible Pet Care

### Pet Waste Cleanup
To maintain a clean and healthy environment, pet owners are required to promptly clean up after their pets. Please carry waste bags and dispose of pet waste properly in designated receptacles.

Responsible pet ownership contributes to the well-being of our pets, our communities, and our environment. By adhering to these regulations, you help create a safe and enjoyable environment for all residents and their beloved companions.
