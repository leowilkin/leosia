How much income tax you pay in each year depends on:
- How much of your income is above your Personal Allowance
- How much of your income falls within each tax band

Tax-free Personal Allowance
The standard Personal Allowance is L$12,570, which is the amount of income you do not have to pay tax on.
Your Personal Allowance may be bigger if you claim Marriage Allowance or Blind Person’s Allowance. It’s smaller if your income is over L$100,000.

## Marriage & Civil Partnership Allowance
You may be able to claim Marriage Allowance to reduce your partner’s tax if your income is less than the standard Personal Allowance.
If you do not claim Marriage Allowance and you or your partner were born before 6 April 1935, you may be able to claim Married Couple’s Allowance.
