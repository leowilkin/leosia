# current tax rates and allowances

## How much income tax you pay in each year depends on:

#### How much of your income is above your Personal Allowance
#### How much of your income falls within each tax band

## Your tax-free Personal Allowance
##### The standard Personal Allowance is £12,570, which is the amount of income you do not have to pay tax on.

##### Your Personal Allowance may be bigger if you claim Marriage Allowance or Blind Person’s Allowance. It’s smaller if your income is over £100,000.
